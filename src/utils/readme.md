Live Site → **https://home-page-ev.onrender.com/**

A forecasting system built to model how **charging infrastructure, population density, and EV adoption** shape Washington State’s transition toward a sustainable electrified future.

---

# 🌟 Why the EV Forecasting System Is Useful

The EV transition depends not only on vehicle availability but also on whether drivers have **reliable access to charging infrastructure**. Washington State’s climate goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by **45% by 2030**, **70% by 2040**, and **95% by 2050** require accelerating EV adoption.

This platform helps planners understand how **charging availability + population density + EV demand** interact and influence statewide electrification success.

---

# 🗺️ 1. Visualizing Population Density vs. Charging Availability

The statewide GIS map overlays population density with existing supercharger locations, showing:

- Counties with **high population but insufficient charging**
- Regions where scarcity creates **high charging anxiety**
- **Uneven distribution** caused by corridor-first infrastructure planning

This reveals counties where adding chargers produces the **highest impact**.

---

# 💰 2. Budget Allocation & County Prioritization

Because EV adoption increases with charging access, the system helps planners:

- Allocate budgets based on **population density**
- Prioritize counties where chargers yield **maximum EV adoption**
- Compare **ROI** of charger deployment

Example insight:

> **“County A needs more chargers due to high density and demand, while County B gains major adoption increases from smaller expansions.”**

---

# 📈 3. Forecast Curves Predict Charging Needs to Meet Policy Goals

Pre-generated cubic and logistic formulas derived from Monte Carlo simulations allow the system to forecast:

- How EV registrations change with added chargers  
- How adoption rates shift across counties  
- Charger counts required to meet **2030–2050 climate mandates**  
- Which counties are **on track** or **falling behind**

Example insights:

- _“Adding 20 superchargers in King County measurably increases EV registrations.”_
- _“WA needs 100+ new chargers statewide by 2030.”_

---

# 🎯 4. Practical Tool for Planners, Utilities & EV Strategists

# 🔧 1.5 Forecast Evaluation Engine

Formulas were created offline using cubic regression (EVs vs. Superchargers) and logistic fits (Adoption Rate vs. Superchargers). During runtime, the app **evaluates** these formulas from Excel.

Example formula in Excel:

```
y = 0.0021*x**3 - 4.7*x**2 + 4500*x - 140000
```

### evaluate_formula(formula_str, x_value)

```python
def evaluate_formula(formula_str, x_value):
    """
    Evaluates a pre-computed polynomial/logistic forecasting formula.

    These formulas were generated previously during the model scale-up phase
    using cubic regression (EVs vs Superchargers) and logistic fits
    (Adoption Rate vs Superchargers), and then exported into Excel files.

    Parameters
    ----------
    formula_str : str
        Cleaned mathematical expression from the Excel file.
        Example: "y = 0.0021*x**3 – 4.7*x**2 + 4500*x – 140000"

    x_value : float
        Number of supercharger points input by user.

    Returns
    -------
    float
        The predicted EV registration or adoption value.
    """
```

This enables fast, transparent, reproducible forecasting.
